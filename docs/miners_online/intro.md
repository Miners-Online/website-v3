# About Miners Online

Welcome to Miners Online, a Minecraft server founded and operated by the President of Samland. It serves as the virtual home for the Samland Government, a sovereign entity existing within the Minecraft worlds provided by Miners Online.

Miners Online is known for its focus on private creative and survival worlds, which are not accessible to the general public. The server offers a collection of open-source software, including Minecraft mods and games.

Despite its offerings, Miners Online has faced challenges in attracting a significant user base beyond the immediate Samland community.

In essence, Miners Online provides a niche space within the Minecraft landscape, catering primarily to the specific interests of its owner and a select few participants.
